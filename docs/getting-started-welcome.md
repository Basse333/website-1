The Token Engineering Community is here to answer the following question: "What does it take to do token engineering, and how we can do it together?" 

## So what is "token engineering?"

Token engineering is a crossdisciplinary field that draws from established practices in systems, electrical, robotics & controls engineering, and more. It also draws from fields as diverse as Behavioural & Ecological Economics, Operations Research, AI & Optimization. It is a methodology that goes all the way from ideation to design, modeling, simulation, testing, deployment, and maintentance. It's the process of building cryptoeconomic systems that work, and keep working. Just like other public infrastructure like bridges and power grids, our future economic systems also need to be rigorously designed to be reliable. The goal of token engineering is to design and create tokeneconomic systems that are robust against exploits and cascade failure, to protect and empower users.

### Define system goals

Token engineering design starts with understanding the desired goals of a given system, and then working backwards to determine the properties and mechanisms required to achieve those goals. What does success look like for your tokeneconomic system?

### Identify mechanisms

As an engineer, you want to design mechanisms where certain properties hold under all conditions. You know you have a mechanism when it cannot be broken down further.

### Compose mechanisms into design patterns

Design patterns are a series of actions that will produce consistent and reproducible results. Often this is state dependent.

### Model & simulate your system

It's important to model, validate, test and iterate your system with tools like [cadCAD](https://www.cadCAD.org) before deploying your code to production.

### Test IRL

Theory only gets us so far. We need to start dogfooding the system in controlled and low-risk experiments.
