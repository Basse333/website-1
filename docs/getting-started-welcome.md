The Token Engineering Community is here to answer the following question: "What does it take to do token engineering, and how we can do it together?" 

## So what is "token engineering?"

Token engineering is a crossdisciplinary field that draws from established practices in systems, electrical, robotics & controls engineering, and more. It also draws from fields as diverse as Behavioural & Ecological Economics, Operations Research, AI & Optimization. It is a methodology that goes all the way from ideation to design, modeling, simulation, testing, deployment, and maintentance. It's the process of building cryptoeconomic systems that work, and keep working. Just like other public infrastructure like bridges and power grids, our future economic systems also need to be rigorously designed to be reliable. The goal of token engineering is to design and create tokeneconomic systems that are robust against exploits and cascade failure, to protect and empower users.

## How does it work?

### Define system goals & properties

Token engineering design starts with understanding the desired goals of a given system, and then working backwards to determine the properties and structure required to achieve those goals. This is carried out in a baseline assessment, including system mapping as described by Stephen Young in this great article on the [token engineering process](https://medium.com/@stephen_yo/a-token-engineering-process-16687f3b9a74).

### Model system & identify necessary mechanisms

The next step in the token engineering process is to produce stock & flow diagrams representing the states of your system and how they change relative to each other. As an engineer, you want to design mechanisms where certain properties hold under all conditions. You know you have a mechanism when it cannot be broken down further.

### Compose mechanisms into design patterns

Design patterns are a series of actions that will produce consistent and reproducible results. Often this is state dependent.

### Simulate & test your system

It's important to model, validate, test and iterate your system with tools like [cadCAD](https://www.cadCAD.org) before deploying your code to production. As discussed in this article by Jeff Emmett on [open token engineering tools](https://medium.com/commonsstack/establishing-open-token-engineering-tools-standards-9584b40dfe30), this step can include A/B testing, parameter sweeps, Monte Carlo analyses and more.

### Test IRL & iterate your model

As in all engineering disciplines, theory only gets us so far. We need to implement & dogfood the designed system in controlled and low-risk environments, and iterate our model with new learnings from deployment. Ultimately, the engineering process does not promise perfect results every time, but it does provide replicable models that we can continually improve.
